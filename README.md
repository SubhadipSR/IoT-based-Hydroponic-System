# IoT-based-Hydroponic-System
Growing plants in the soil can be challenging as the land for cultivation is decreasing rapidly due to high population. In this scenario we need a soil-less cultivation method that can fulfill our needs. The aim of this project is to design and construct an automatic hydroponic system that does not depend on the outside climate.
